    "input_abstract": "This research investigates the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy and efficiency of credit scoring systems. By integrating big data analytics and natural language processing, the proposed model assesses borrower creditworthiness using both traditional financial metrics and alternative data sources such as social media behavior and transaction history. The system aims to reduce bias and enhance decision-making processes in financial institutions.",
